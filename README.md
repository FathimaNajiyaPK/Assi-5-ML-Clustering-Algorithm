# Assi-5-ML-Clustering-Algorithm
# Objective
This project applies two clustering algorithms—KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering—to the Iris dataset in order to explore their effectiveness in unsupervised machine learning.
1. KMeans Clustering:

- Used the KMeans algorithm with 3 clusters (since there are 3 species in the Iris dataset).

- Visualized the clusters to show how the algorithm groups the data based on similarity.

2. Hierarchical Clustering:

- Applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group data into clusters.

- Created a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical relationships between clusters.

Key Points:
- The Iris dataset was preprocessed by dropping the species column (since it's a clustering problem).

- The results of both clustering techniques were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
